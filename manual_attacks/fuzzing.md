FUZZING PLAYBOOK (High-level conceptual guidance)
Purpose: Describe fuzzing methodology for testing robustness without providing exploit payloads.
Guidance:
1. Prepare a test firmware/device that can be reset easily; always perform fuzzing on test devices only.
2. Use synthetic fuzz inputs in a sandboxed environment; capture crashes and logs.
3. Focus on coverage metrics, not destructive payloads. Use emulation/simulation where possible.
4. Report findings with stack traces, reproduction steps, and recommended remediations.
